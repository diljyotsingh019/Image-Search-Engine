# Image Search Engine
Image search engine can be used to find similar images from the database. Images are first converted into 5 different fragments and histogram for each of the fragment is calculated. Next, as an output, pictures from the database with comparable histograms are retrieved. Chi-square distances are measured between the input image and the images available in the database.
